# Learn Linked List

So here i will be learning about linkedList before i go to the linked list section on neetcode. I will be learning through this OP guy called Alvin from his youtube vid

So lets learn today. as usual, the note is what I am currently thinking on my head. So yeah.

# Day 1:

## My thought:

- Linked list, i actually every learned linked list before. Its like 4 years ago or so. But at that time, i just didnt really know what this is all about so yeah? But now i will try to understand it like throughly.
- From here, I know that linked list on neetcode or leetcode is already defined with the nodes. but i will need to learn how to make the node myself and try to do things with it, well lets just go and study.
- I will try to insert a node by myself. he explained that i can insert it by doing something along the line of make the current to a different place. Welllll, lets try it ourself
- Wow, i actually did it (Probably), thats cool. Lets continue watching the video
- Now he is gonna try to do it recursively. let me try that by my own
- Cool, i think i did it. now lets see how he do it... Okay its literally the same, well yeah its to be expected.
- Okay, i think i need to break this note to section. because its getting harder and harder to read

## First problem (node into list)

- I think this should be easy, let me do it on my own first.
- There u go, done in 10 second
- OH AND BY THE WAY I GOT A REALLY EXCITING NEWS. Remember when i struggle about time complexity. Its safe to say that now i am way better at deriving time complexity. Its really exciting just because its been actual months. I stopped learning DP not because i wanna stop. I just think that there is a proper way or path to learn, and i choose leetcode. Well from that 2 hours of DP, i actually got a lot of things. Im better at recursion and hashmap / dictionary because of that. So lets continue.
- He actually did the thing inside a function. Okay i will make a function then
- Done. Lets continue
- Not he try to do it recursively. Lets try it.
- OKAY WAIT I JUST REALIZE I CAN DO IT IN MORE .py FILE... okay..
- Okay i can import the node. thats cool.
- Okay, i am quite stuck. i want to have a node ready for me that i can use for another file but i dont really know how to do it yet. So i will do it the old way then.
- Okay im done with the recursion.
- Okay, he dont want all my recursive function to have an array of its own, so he have 2 function. Let me try that.
- Okay, i am done. Its 0.14 now. I will see you guys again like today. Well today i will be reviewing all my neetcode with my friend. So yeah, after reviewing is done, maybe i can continue or just sleep if its already too late. See you.

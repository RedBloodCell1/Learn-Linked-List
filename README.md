So lets learn today. as usual, the note is what I am currently thinking on my head. So yeah.

Day 1:

- Linked list, i actually every learned linked list before. Its like 4 years ago or so. But at that time, i just didnt really know what this is all about so yeah? But now i will try to understand it like throughly.
- From here, I know that linked list on neetcode or leetcode is already defined with the nodes. but i will need to learn how to make the node myself and try to do things with it, well lets just go and study.
- I will try to insert a node by myself. he explained that i can insert it by doing something along the line of make the current to a different place. Welllll, lets try it ourself
